## Creating my First Crowbox
### 25/09/21 -> 02/10/21

I first downlaoded the geomtery files from the [Crowbox website](https://thecrowbox.com/). The files were in a DXF format, which is standard for laser cutting 2D drawings onto 3D elements. I contacted multiple laser printing companies and managed to finalise the details with a company in Lisbon called Dholetec. From all the parts that were printed, there was an issue with just one part. As can be seen below, the two parts should be identical, however, one of the parts does not have the correct indentation at the top. Dholetec managed to fix the issues, though it did take a few days as the weekend came in between. 

Error in printing:

The next step was to collect the equipment I needed to build the box. The [website](https://thecrowbox.com/wiki/doku.php?id=kit:CrowBox2_v20_bom) offered a Bill of Materials, where every equipment was specified. Given that this box was created in the United States and I am based in Portugal, I was not able to locate certain pieces of equipment. For example, an important adhesive used to hold the box together was the Acrylic Cement. I instead used a standard glue with a cauk gun, as shown below.
