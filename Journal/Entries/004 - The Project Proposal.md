## The Project Proposal
### 16/07/21

Having refined the project's goals and objectives, I have created and shared my Project Proposal with my Supervisors. Here is the gist of it below. 

### Project Motivation
The Crow Box faces certain issues regarding the User Experience. To alternate between the training stages, the user must constantly disassemble and access the internal electrical components of the box. Furthermore, to conduct a status update, the user must manually check the box for issues, presence of food, number of coins deposited etc. To increase the potential number of humans participating in this Citizen Science programme, the Crow Box must be more accessible and user friendly for the participants. As a result, the motivation of this project is to develop the User Experience of the Crow Box, making it more appealing, attractive and accessible to future (as well as current) participants.

### Target Users
The current user group for the Crow Box ranges from Students at University to Electronics/Robotics Enthusiasts. The focus of this project is to open the box up to users who enjoy interacting with a webpage more than constantly altering the state of electronic components e.g. the Arduino.

### Key Objectives
* Introduce a WiFi module to the Arduino Uno R3 (the microcontroller of the Crow Box) to be able to wirelessly receive data. 
* Data would include: Number of coins deposited - Amount of coins remaining in the dispenser (weight) - Amount of food remaining (weight) - Number of times a crow landed on the perch. 
* Wirelessly control the Crow Box by switching through the 4 training stages. 
* Create a Website to display the data and act as a remote control. 
* Be able to provide instant feedback on the box’s current state.

### Main Challenges
* Integrating extra sensors such as weight and  humidity/water sensors within the confines of the box.
* Ensuring the Crow Box is within a suitable distance to a Wi-Fi connection. 
* Connecting the Arduino Uno R3 to a WiFi Module 

### Evaluation
The project’s primary objective is to reduce the barriers to entry for the Crow Box by improving the User Experience. The project will be successful if current Crow Box users are seamlessly able to adapt their current Crow Boxes to the newer version that will be defined by this project. In addition to this, the project must garner sufficient interest and manage to convince those who lack the interest in robotics/CAD engineering to become involved with the project.
