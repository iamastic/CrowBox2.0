## Creating a Video Demo

For the 3rd Prototype, alongside the original in person interviews I ran to gather feedback, I also created a [video demonstration of the site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnGLdI3y_Oo). I then shared this video on the [Google Crowbox Group Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/CrowBoxKit/c/p-4TZWLMcbk) asking for feedback on the site. This was accompanied by a simple online survey which the users may fill out. Alternatively, the users could also comment below in the forum if they do not wish to remain anonymous. 

### The Survey

The survey asked 3 questions and provided comment boxes to be filled out: 

1. What do you think of the overall look and feel of the website?
2. Is there anything else you wish the website could do? 
3. Any further comments? (e.g. on the design, colour, placement of content etc)
