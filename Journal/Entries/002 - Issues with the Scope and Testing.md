## Issues with the Scope and Testing
### 14/06/21

While fleshing out the project, I have begun to realise the difficulties I would face regarding the time I have at hand. The duration of this project is 3-4 months. In order to complete a successful project, I would need to build several iterations of the box. My plan is to be able to test various components of the box individually. This is to ensure that the Crows do not get confused by two different training protocols at the same time e.g. Introducing lights as well as sound as a means of instructing the Crows. 

In order to achieve this, I would have to build a box, place it in a suitable environment e.g. a garden. I would then have to wait for crows (perhaps more than 5 would be a suitable number) to test it out. I would then need to ensure that the Crows eventually learn the instruction and are able to effeciently complete the task while enjoying the food reward at the very end. 

Upon reading a majority of user experiences from the google forum, I have learnt that Crows are extremely cautious and skittish animals. As a result, it takes a while (appears to be more than 2 weeks) for crows to become acclamitised with the box (or any new instrument in their surroundings). After which, it remains undetermined how long it may take for the crows to actually become trained. This would then beg the question, how long must the testing period be? 

As can be noted, with the limited time frame of 3-4 months, it would be unfeasible to conclusively test several iterations of the Crow Box. Something needs to change.
