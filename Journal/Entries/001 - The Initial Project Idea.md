## The Initial Project Idea
### 19/04/2021 

The project's focus, currently (the very beginning) is to improve the Crow Box. The current prototype of the Crow Box may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcp_FWfYtLY&ab_channel=CrowBoxOfficial) and further information may be found [here](http://www.thecrowbox.com/).

As a Citizen Science project, the Crow Box has a google groups forum where users/potential users discuss their experiences and share their success/failure stories. Upon conducting research on this forum, it has been noted that there were multiple issues with the Crow Box that may inhibit a wide-scale uptake of the project. 

The issues are as follows: 
* The box was difficult to clean from the inside. Opening the box and removing the electronics without causing damage was a hassle. 
* The food lid has the tendency to get jammed when sliding open. 
* The box is easily damaged by other animals e.g. squirrels.
* Changing the Training Stage (of which there are 4) can be difficult. The user must partially disassemble the box, retrieve the Arduino, press the button a certain number of times and reset the entire device. 
* Checking which Training Stage you are currently on is difficult as well as there is no primary indicator. 

The focus of the project at this stage is to reinvent the Crow Box's purpose. Currently it solely serves as a box that allows Crows to deposit pennies and be rewarded with food in return. The objective is to create a more robust box that allowed researchers/users to apply different training methodologies. 

For example, here are a few questions being asked at this stage:

* Can we get crows to pull a lever? 
* Can we get crows to follow lights or arrows to complete and instruction? 
* Can we get crows to understand the purpose of specific sounds and their relationship to an instruction?
