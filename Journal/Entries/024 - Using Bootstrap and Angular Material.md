## Using Bootstrap and Angular Material

Given that I am building the frontend in Angular, it made sense to use the native styling libraries from [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/). However, in the Data component page, I make use of two charts. To display the two charts, I wanted to sit them in a carousel so that the user may cycle through and switch between the charts. Angular Material appears to not provide any simple integration of carousels. So I resorted to using bootstrap. 

After installing bootstrap, I also installed [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home). This is a wrapper library that allows you to use angular directives when styling with bootstrap.
