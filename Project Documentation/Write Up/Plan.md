## The Plan

### Start
* Title Page 
  * Acknowledgments 
  * Signed Declaration 
  * Covid 19 Statement

* Executive Summary 
  * Strong statement to summarise the entire project in one sentence. 
  * Followed by a brief description of the problem alongside an outline of everything that was built  

### Main Body
* Section 1
  * Introduction 
    * The purpose of the Crowbox and its role as a Citizen Science Project 
    *  Analysis on the intelligence of Corvid Species and the benefit of this project being successful 
    *  Outline on how the Crowbox works
    *  The User Base of the Crowbox - Target Users
    *  The issue of the low uptake and lack of data aggregation + communication between members of the community 
    *  The inability for the project to be a widescale success due to the aforementioned problem 
  * Aims and Objectives
    * Higher Level Objectives 
      *  Integrate an IoT System into an existing Citizen Science Project
      *  Improve the user experience, thereby encouraging a higher uptake of the project
      *  Improve the data collection, aggregation and sharing method to encourage users to train corvid species
    *  Lower Level Objectives
       *  Introduce WiFi into the Crowbox, giving it the ability to communicate wireless to the user
       *  Create a website for users to view their data being updated in real time 
       *  Introduce a troubleshoot system that analyses the box's condition and notifies the user of any issues
       *  Enable the user to share their results for the world to see
* Section 2
  * Background and Context
    * Brief explanation of what the original Crowbox Project was about (citing the original dissertation)
    * CAD Designing and Laser Printing 
    * What is an IoT System
    * Existing Citizen Science Projects that employ an IoT system (or do not, yet manage to share data on a wide scale)
    * Design Practices - Design Thinking and Agile - Brief comparison of different design practices
    * The practice of integrating an IoT System
    * The Microcontrollers: Arduino, ATMega, ESP8266, ESP32, NodeMCU - comparison and discussion for best fit
    * The Pricing Structure - Lowering or maintaining the price as much as possible of the build 
    * Displaying the Data - The type of data, private vs public data, sharing preferences
    * The notification system 
    * What about offline? Accommodating for WiFi issues e.g. short range or inavailability 
    * Software decisions - which STACK to use for web dev? Coding in C++ and Arduino language - considering Docker - Using Github 
    * Continuous integration - issues with this and why it was not done? Or perhaps, it was done through online surveys and in person users.
