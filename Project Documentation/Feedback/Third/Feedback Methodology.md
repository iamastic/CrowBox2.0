This feedback session was conducted on the [Third Prototype - Website V1](https://github.com/iamastic/CrowBox2.0/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Ideation/The%20Website/Third%20Prototype%20(Website%20V1).md).
In this feedback session I invited two new Users to the session. These users had previously not been a part of the feedback sessions nor did they know much about the Crowbox. To start off with, I explained to them what the original Crowbox was built to do. I then explained how my project played its part in improving the current crowbox version. 

Rather than giving the users free reigns the entire time, I decided to provide them with a series of tasks to complete. I then observed the users' actions, where they clicked and how long they took to figure something out. I also asked for their opinions on various aspects of the website and occassionaly asked them why they expected certain buttons (for example) to do certain things.
