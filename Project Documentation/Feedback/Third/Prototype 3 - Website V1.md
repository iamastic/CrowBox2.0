### **ACTION:** 

Starting from the Home Page: 

### **1) Can you find the About Section?**

The user did not realise that that this page was scrollable. They were unable to figure out how to get to the About Page as there was no inidicator (other than the scroll bar to the right) that you could go down. Eventually, I hinted that they could scroll. They quickly picked it up and was able to find the About Section. 


### **2) Can you find out how to Get Started?**

Granted that this was just below the About Section, the user was able to find it with ease. 

### **ACTION:** 

I then gave the user free reigns, and asked them what they would like to do next. They clicked the "Login" button. I filled out the details with a premade account and asked them to pretend as if they had already set up this account earlier. Upon logging in, the user was redirected to the "DATA" Page. 

### **3) Do you know which page you are on right now? What is your guess?**

The user checked the top header and knew they were on the DATA Page. 

### **4) Could you tell me the total number of coins that have been deposited?**

The user scanned the page but was eventually able to tell me the correct answer (9).

### **5) Could you tell me what the number of crows that landed on the perch are on the 20th of November 2021?**

The user's first response was 13, which is incorrect as it is the Total Number of Crows that had Landed on the Perch. I realised that the label does not have the word "Total" before it in this version of the website. I asked the user to try again. Eventually the user came across the graph and studied it briefly. They used the horizontal lines running across the graph to calculate the number for the correct date. The user did not hover over the bar chart - they did not know they could do so. 

### **6) Could you tell me what the number of coins deposited are on the 19th of November, 2021?**

The user struggled to see the "next" and "previous" buttons on the graph to switch between them. They did not try to click on the graphs either and were unable to find the graph that shows the coins deposited data. After allowing them to explore, I encouraged them to try and click on everything they think might lead them to the correct graph. The user clicked on the "Total Coins Deposited" value. They then tried to click on the bar charts of the graph. Eventually, the spotted the "next" button and clicked it. That's when they were able to easily give me the answer. 

### **7) Could you tell me the number of coins deposited in Portugal?**

The user scanned the page for a while, looking everywhere. They then clicked on the "PUBLIC" button. Since they already had experience navigating between the two charts, they were able to easily find the value. Not only did they find they value, but they accidentally hovered over the bar and realised they could read it right off while hovering rather than using the horizontal lines. 

### **8) Could you change the current training stage of the crowbox?**

The user easily achieved this. 

### **9) Could you tell me if the Crow Box is in working order? If not, then how would you check?**

The user read the "Status" point at the bottom right of the DATA page. They saw it said nothing. I then asked them how they would go about checking the box? They scanned the DATA page but could not find anything related to the status. I then encouraged them to use the "entirety" of the website. That's when they spotted "TROUBLESHOOT" and immediately switched to that page. This appears to be an unclear process. 

### **10) Could you tell me if the food level in the crowbox is high or low?**

The user was unsure about this as they did not understand what "WORKING" meant. They suggested that this should be more specific. 

### **11) Could you change your Location?**

The user scanned the page once again and eventually went to PROFILE page. Upon going there, they first tried to discover what the current location was set to. They found it was "Portugal". They tried to click "Portugal" but to no avail. They then scanned the page again, and noticed the buttons on the bottom left of the site. They clicked on "Change Location". Due to the color of the background and text, they did not see the drop down arrow. As a result, they tried typing but it did not work. When the realised it was a drop down, they changed the country to "Algeria". 

### **12) Could you change your notification settings preferences?**

They did not expect this to be a drop down list, but were eventually able to change this. 

### **13) How would you logout?**

This was done with ease.
