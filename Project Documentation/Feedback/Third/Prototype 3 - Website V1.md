# User 1

### **ACTION:** 

Starting from the Home Page: 

### **1) Can you find the About Section?**

The user did not realise that that this page was scrollable. They were unable to figure out how to get to the About Page as there was no inidicator (other than the scroll bar to the right) that you could go down. Eventually, I hinted that they could scroll. They quickly picked it up and was able to find the About Section. 


### **2) Can you find out how to Get Started?**

Granted that this was just below the About Section, the user was able to find it with ease. 

### **ACTION:** 

I then gave the user free reigns, and asked them what they would like to do next. They clicked the "Login" button. I filled out the details with a premade account and asked them to pretend as if they had already set up this account earlier. Upon logging in, the user was redirected to the "DATA" Page. 

### **3) Do you know which page you are on right now? What is your guess?**

The user checked the top header and knew they were on the DATA Page. 

### **4) Could you tell me the total number of coins that have been deposited?**

The user scanned the page but was eventually able to tell me the correct answer (9).

### **5) Could you tell me what the number of crows that landed on the perch are on the 20th of November 2021?**

The user's first response was 13, which is incorrect as it is the Total Number of Crows that had Landed on the Perch. I realised that the label does not have the word "Total" before it in this version of the website. I asked the user to try again. Eventually the user came across the graph and studied it briefly. They used the horizontal lines running across the graph to calculate the number for the correct date. The user did not hover over the bar chart - they did not know they could do so. 

### **6) Could you tell me what the number of coins deposited are on the 19th of November, 2021?**
