## Feedback Methodology 

The users sourced for the first feedback session were close friends and family. I managed to borrow time off of 3 individuals, who each spent approximately 20-30 minutes reviewing and providing feedback on the first prototype. Each user reviewed the box seperately. 

### Step 1

The users who participated in the feedback session were unfamiliar with the Crowbox. They had never heard of it as a concept, nor had they built one. With the aid of the Crowbox's introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcp_FWfYtLY&t=4s), as well as showing them my current build of the Crowbox, I briefly explained to them the purpose and functionality of the box. The project was then explained to the users, wherein I described the main objectives of building a Website for the Crowbox to be connected and controlled over WiFi. I explained how this is to improve the User Experience of the box, allowing users to receive and send data to the Crowbox over WiFi in realtime. 

### Step 2
Having explained to them the purpose of the Crowbox and the main objectives of the project surrounding it, I introduced to them the [paper prototypes]()
