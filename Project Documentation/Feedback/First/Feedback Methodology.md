## Feedback Methodology 

The users sourced for the first feedback session were close friends and family. I managed to borrow time off of 3 individuals, who each spent approximately 20-30 minutes reviewing and providing feedback on the first prototype. Each user reviewed the box seperately. 

### Step 1

The users who participated in the feedback session were unfamiliar with the Crowbox. They had never heard of it as a concept, nor had they built one. With the aid of the Crowbox's introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcp_FWfYtLY&t=4s), as well as showing them my current build of the Crowbox, I briefly explained to them the purpose and functionality of the box. The project was then explained to the users, wherein I described the main objectives of building a Website for the Crowbox to be connected and controlled over WiFi. I explained how this is to improve the User Experience of the box, allowing users to receive and send data to the Crowbox over WiFi in realtime. 

### Step 2
Having explained to them the purpose of the Crowbox and the main objectives of the project surrounding it, I introduced to them the [paper prototypes](https://github.com/iamastic/CrowBox2.0/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Ideation/The%20Website/First%20Prototype%20(Paper%20Prototype).pdf). I had sketched out 4 of the main pages of the Website, each labelled in the bottom right corner of the page. At the bottom of the website, I had written a brief explanation of this page. I allowed the user to read this explanation as well as study the page for roughly 3-5 minutes. 

### Step 3
The user had now studied the page in question as well as read the brief explanation at the bottom of the page. Given the limited content, I decided against preparing any questions, so not to direct or influence the user's opinions e.g. if I ask the user about a certain element, it may lead to them ignoring other elements. As a result, I simply asked them to give me their thoughts, first impressions and reactions to the prototype. I noted these down on paper. The user was allowed to ask questions about what certain elements do if they were unclear in the prototype. 

Step 3 was then repeated for each page.
