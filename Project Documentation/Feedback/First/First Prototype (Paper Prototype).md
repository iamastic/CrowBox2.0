## Feedback on the Paper Prototype
### 03/10/2021

The feedback was conducted on the [First Prototype - Paper Prototype](https://github.com/iamastic/CrowBox2.0/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Ideation/The%20Website/First%20Prototype%20(Paper%20Prototype).pdf)

### Page 1

* What happens when a user clicks "sign up"? There is no example or explanation for that. How will a user connect a box to the website?
* Is there an introduction page? Maybe include a seperate page describing the project and the crowbox.
* Move the "login/sign up" to the bottom of the box. It will look better and follows common design practices of other sites. 
* The blurred out view in the background is cool! Invites the user to sign up if they haven't already as they get a glimpse of what is behind it. 


### Page 2

* Have the "USERS" on the top right side of the window, as most social media follow that pattern. 
* Maybe change the name to something other than "USERS"? "Profile" might be better. 
* If there is a graph showing coins deposited per location, why not have a graph showing the number of crows landing on the perch per location? 
* Since there are two graphs showing the users data and a graph showing the other users' data, perhaps create a seperate tab for them. 
* Are users allowed to have more than one box per account? If so, what would happen? How would that fit into the website? 

### Page 3

* What if the "Report" section has a lot of content? How will you fit it in the box? 
* Is there a notification system? It would be good if the "TROUBLESHOOT" panel was highlighted in red if there was something to report. 
* The words used to report are confusing. What does "GOOD" or "LOW" mean? You have used so many different words, perhaps stick to a select few and make them standard. 
* The "Report" section doesn't look good at the top. Maybe have a pop out window instead. It will make the page look cleaner.
