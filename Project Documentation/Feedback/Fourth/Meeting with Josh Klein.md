## Meeting with Josh Klein 
### 06/12/2021

- Showed him the website
- Discussed improvements e.g. image sharing, pintrest style board, offline mode, costs of building, issues with various prototypes and being expensive, trying to get users on board 
- Discussed bugs: power supply issues, servo issues - setting up a fault check for the servo 
- Discussed the advantages of data aggregation - being able to check when crows are most active - which training stage do they thrive in the most - what seasons/locations - checking for anomalies e.g. if there are predators in the area such as falcons, the crows disappeared resulting in no data. With the website, it would be good to be able to analyse this
- Open source advantages
- Press release in the near future to gain popularity 
- Getting members on board privately first before releasing it into the wild for further testing
