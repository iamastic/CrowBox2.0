### Step 1 Feedback 

| Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Feedback Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| The user's mouse hovered around the page randomly at first. I assumed they were reading the content on the page. They then tried to click on the different headers such as "DATA" and "PROFILE". Those buttons did not work and they were confused as to why they did not work. I explained to them that since the user had not signed in yet and as such, would not be allowed to access the various different headers.                                                                   | The home page should be completely seperate from the other pages, and the user should not be able to see the other headers if they cannot access them. If a button doesn't work, then why is it there?                                                                                      |
| The user clicked the "Sign Up" button first, instead of the "log in" button. I assume this was because they were pretending to be a newcomer to this project and website. They entered gibberish into the fill in boxes and clicked "proceed". They came across the "Halt!" message and thought that while it was a good warning, it might not be necessary.                                                                                                                               | Instead of a giant warning message, why not allow the user to proceed normally anyway? If they enter the wrong details at a later point or something does not work, have some provision to allow for the error. Allow the user to resubmit. Do not create a "point of no return" situation. |
| They entered the box's name and liked the example of what would happen if a box could not be found. They suggested that this already makes the "Halt!" message redundant. They clicked proceed and was greeted by the "DATA" page. They scanned the page for a bit and clicked on "PUBLIC DATA" first. They did not try to slide between the data charts.                                                                                                                                  | Ensure the user knows that there is more than one chart for "USER DATA" and "PUBLIC DATA". Perhaps make the slider bar visible at all times.                                                                                                                                                |
| The user noticed that they could alternate between boxes. They liked the simple information displayed on the box. The user then went to the "TROUBLESHOOT" panel. The first thing they did was switch the crowboxes. I assume this is because it is at the top of the page. After changing the crowboxes, they were immediately attracted to the bells ringing. They clicked on each one and read the information. The user did not click on the Question Mark next to the crowbox's name. | The question mark's purpose is to provide an overview of the box's status. It seems unclear that this is a button to this user. Perhaps an alternate method such as a pop up box at the beginner would be more effective in providing a summary.                                            |
| The user clicked on the "PROFILE" tab and scanned through. They then clicked on the "HOME" panel again and were greeted with the "Sign Up" box. They wondered why that was, and I explained it to be a limitation of the prototype software. In realtiy, it would simply navigate to the original "HOME" page with all the information and the user would remain signed in.                                                                                                                | No remarks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
### Step 2 Feedback 
The remaining pages left unexplored by the user was the "log in" process as well as the second data chart. This was quite simple, however, as the user only needed enter their details and it would immediately take them to the "DATA" page. After explaining the entire process to the user, in terms of how to set up the box and then connect to the website, I allowed the user to offer their thoughts on the process. 

* The first point the user brought up was what if someone did not have WiFi and still wished to record their data on the Website? Would there be a provision for them? In this scenario, the user must have set up the box as per the specification. Only then would they be able to successfully create an account. Without WiFi, however, the box could not be set up as per the requirements. So it would not work for them. 
* The User wondered why the people could not create an account without a box? What if they wanted to check out the various headers of the website but were not fully sold on purchasing/building a Crowbox?
* The user wondered how someone would be able to switch the training phase of the box? They recalled I had mentioned this feature in the previous session but were unable to find a button to control the box from the website. 

### Step 3 Feedback

User reported that the background color is "bland". It appears slightly washed out rather than vibrant. 

The fonts are basic and not unique. Can't go wrong with that. Simplicity may work best for a website whose goal is to provide and display data. 

The washed out background defintely allows the font colors to pop out a lot more. The user noticed some inconsistencies where the headers were either dark blue or black. Dark blue appeared to be better in their opinion. The green and blue combinations worked well most of the time. In the "TROUBLESHOOT" section, they did not like how the "report for" text looked against the dark green background. Font sizes worked well too. Except for the "TROUBLESHOOT" section in which the actual status updates might be a bit too large. 

As brought up earlier, the User would remove the "Halt!" message box.  

As they did not notice you could switch between different charts, they feel like the organisation could have been more effective. Some kind of indicator, or perhaps positioning both charts together.

The troubleshoot page was clear enough. The user could not provide too much feedback on the content in the message boxes of the issues as they had not faced any of the issues and as such, did not know if it was informative enough. The only issue was that in the data section, the user did not really notice that their was a message at the bottom providing the status update of the box. This is easy to miss. A notification or pop up system would be more effective if the status ever changes.

It was clear and easy.
