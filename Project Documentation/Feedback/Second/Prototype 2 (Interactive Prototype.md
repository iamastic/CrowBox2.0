## Second Prototype (Interactive)
### 12/10/21

The feedback was conducted on the following prototype: [Interactive Prototype](https://github.com/iamastic/CrowBox2.0/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Ideation/The%20Website/Second%20Prototype%20(Interactive).md#screen-1). Please visit the [Feedback Methodology](https://github.com/iamastic/CrowBox2.0/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Feedback/Second/Feedback%20Methodology.md) to view how this session was conducted. 

### Step 1 Feedback 
The user's mouse hovered around the page randomly at first. I assumed they were reading the content on the page. They then tried to click on the different headers such as "DATA" and "PROFILE". Those buttons did not work and they were confused as to why they did not work. I explained to them that since the user had not signed in yet and as such, would not be allowed to access the various different headers. 

The home page should be completely seperate from the other pages, and the user should not be able to see the other headers if they cannot access them. If a button doesn't work, then why is it there?

The user clicked the "Sign Up" button first, instead of the "log in" button. I assume this was because they were pretending to be a newcomer to this project and website. They entered gibberish into the fill in boxes and clicked "proceed". They came across the "Halt!" message and thought that while it was a good warning, it might not be necessary. 

Instead of a giant warning message, why not allow the user to proceed normally anyway? If they enter the wrong details at a later point or something does not work, have some provision to allow for the error. Allow the user to resubmit. Do not create a "point of no return" situation.

They entered the box's name and liked the example of what would happen if a box could not be found. They suggested that this already makes the "Halt!" message redundant. They clicked proceed and was greeted by the "DATA" page. They scanned the page for a bit and clicked on "PUBLIC DATA" first. They did not try to slide between the data charts. 

Ensure the user knows that there is more than one chart for "USER DATA" and "PUBLIC DATA". Perhaps make the slider bar visible at all times. 

The user noticed that they could alternate between boxes. They liked the simple information displayed on the box. The user then went to the "TROUBLESHOOT" panel. The first thing they did was switch the crowboxes. I assume this is because it is at the top of the page. After changing the crowboxes, they were immediately attracted to the bells ringing. They clicked on each one and read the information. The user did not click on the Question Mark next to the crowbox's name. 

The question mark's purpose is to provide an overview of the box's status. It seems unclear that this is a button to this user. Perhaps an alternate method such as a pop up box at the beginner would be more effective in providing a summary. 

The user clicked on the "PROFILE" tab and scanned through. They then clicked on the "HOME" panel again and were greeted with the "Sign Up" box. They wondered why that was, and I explained it to be a limitation of the prototype software. In realtiy, it would simply navigate to the original "HOME" page with all the information and the user would remain signed in. 

No remarks.
