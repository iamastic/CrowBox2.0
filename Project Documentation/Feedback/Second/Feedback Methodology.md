## Feedback Methodology

This feedback session was conducted with one individual. The session lasted less than 30 minutes. The user who reviewed the prototype was involved in the previous feedback session and as a result, they knew of and understood the project's objectives and motivations. They were also familiar with the Crowbox and the website's initial design. 

### Step 1
At first, I gave the user free reigns and allowed them to explore the interactive prototype by clicking all the buttons they wished to. They navigated to most pages. During this process, I took down notes of where the User attempted to go and if they were expecting a different result each time. If the user did expect something different to happen, they were encouraged to let me know about it. 

### Step 2
After navigating to most pages, I then showed the User the remainder of the pages they did not explore. I then explained to them the entire process of the website's sign up and log in:
* User will first be asked to set up the code and upload it onto their NodeMCU ESP32. Inside this code, they will be asked to fill in their WiFi credentials, their unique username and their Crowbox's unique id or name. 
* After uploading the code and setting up the Crowbox, the user will then create an account on the website (if they have not already) with the same username. 
* The user will enter the unique id or name of their Crowbox in order to link it to their account. 
* Once everything has been verified and linked, the User will be able to navigate to the various tabs such as "Data" and Troubleshoot" and "Profile", which were previously locked away from the user. 

### Step 3
I was seeking feedback not only on the process but also the design. As a result, I had prepared questions surrounding the User Experience and UI design of the website (instead of asking about the process, in order to not misguide the user's judgement). The questions were:
* What is your initial response of the background color? 
* What is your initial response of the fonts used? 
* What about the font sizes and colors? Do they complement each other as well as the background? 
* Is there any design aspect of the Website you would like to see removed?
* What do you think of the organisation of the various content on the DATA screen? 
* Is the Troubleshoot screen informative? Are you able to tell if something is in working order or not? 
* How easy or difficult is it for you to navigate between the two boxes? Could you tell there was more than one crowbox for this account?

### Step 4
In this step, I requested the user to provide me with general feedback on the process of setting up the box. I asked them to put themselves in the shoes of someone who is just about to jump on board of this Citizen Science project. They walked through the process and I attempted to see where the issues would arise.
