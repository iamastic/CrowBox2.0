## The Google Forum 

The Crow Box community has set up a [google forum](https://groups.google.com/g/CrowBoxKit) where users can ask questions, share issues as well as share results. The user is able to create a post and other users may interact with said post through commenting below. This is the primary method provided to Crow Box users to interact with one another. After reading through multiple posts, I have developed initial User Stories and Insights.
