# The First Mood Board

## #1

This website has a wonderful display of various charts. This is something I would like to integrate into the Crowbox data collection website. I would like to offer the users the ability to switch between different data representation modes such as, but not limited to, a line graph, a pie chart, or a bar graph. Users will be able to see data such as the number of coins dispensed into the box each month or week, or the number of coins dispensed with respect to the user's location.

Similar to #1, this website uses a variety of data representation modes. Though, it would be better if the user could cycle through them rather than displaying all of them at once.

This website's use of green is attractive, and fits perfectly into the Crowbox's color design, which happens to also be green/dark green.
