## What should go on the Website? 

In this section, I will be outlining, on a preliminary basis, the core aspects of the website. This will be based on User Stories/Insights I have derieved from the [Google Forum Insights](https://github.com/iamastic/CrowBox2.0/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/Ideation/Insights/001%20-%20The%20Google%20Forum.md#the-google-forum) section.

For each User Story, I have listed the various elements that may be incorporated into the design of the Website to help solve them. 

* I want to be able to access and visualise my data (e.g. number of coins collected, amount of food remaining) autonomously and in real time in order to better manipulate the 4 Training Stages.
* I want to be able to immediately know/be notified when my Servo Motor stops working, as this is a common occurrence.	
* I want to be immediately notified when parts of the Crow Box are damaged e.g. the Food Dispenser's Styrene Sheet	
* I want to be immediately notified when the sliding lid for the Food Dispenser is jammed, as this is a common occurrence.
* I want to be notified if rain or water seeps into my box, as this may damage my electronics permanently.
